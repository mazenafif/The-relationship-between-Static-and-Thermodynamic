Thus, the bad boyfriend affect other genes unconsciously , are those emitters&nbsp; role Guides, to get rid of those we must put polarized network entropy.<br></div><div><u><b>Chapter 4: Heart relationship to rule by Exponential growth function</b></u><br></div><div>The heart is the most powerful source of electromagnetic energy in the human body, producing the largest rhythmic electromagnetic field of any of the body's organs. The heart's electrical field is about 60 times greater in amplitude than the electrical activity generated by the brain. This field measured in the form of an electrocardiogram ( ECG ), can be detected anywhere on the surface of the body, [ see more: "Science of the heart" by Rollin McCraty, HeartMath Institute, V2:&nbsp; 2015]. Thus, that electromagnetic waves emitted by the cells of the body play a role in the work we do and the impact, in essence, this means changes in the core content, for example cooking when a man/woman, prepare the food, he/she feels no satisfaction to do so, or the sense is dedicated and is satisfied with it Labour, the competent thought cells which are in the heart exported electricity emissions static splash lead to the disruption of entropy between molecules that meal and then merge polymers those emissions with polymers food ingredient compounds have different molecular weights, where there is a substitution negative during molecular complementarity and thus return a negative impact on consumers, this means becoming deficient nutritional value and may even become harmful genetically. Moreover, the quantitative growth exponent of the heart is growing even affect the air molecules and lead to global warming. Heart effects on the environment is directly proportional to the negatives quanta and inversely with the positives quanta.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
