The heart's electrical field is about 60 times greater in amplitude than the electrical activity generated by the brain. This field measured in the form of an electrocardiogram ( ECG ), can be detected anywhere on the surface of the body, [ see more: "Science of the heart" by Rollin McCraty, HeartMath Institute, 2015]. Thus, that electromagnetic waves emitted by the cells of the body play a role in the work we do and the impact, in essence, this means changes in the core content, for example cooking when a man/woman, prepare the food, he/she feels no satisfaction to do so, or the sense is dedicated and is satisfied with it Labour, the competent thought cells which are in the heart exported electricity emissions static splash lead to the disruption of entropy between molecules that meal and then merge polymers those emissions with polymers food ingredient compounds have different molecular weights, where there is a substitution negative during molecular complementarity and thus return a negative impact on consumers, this means becoming deficient nutritional value and may even become harmful genetically. Moreover, the quantitative growth exponent of the heart is growing even affect the air molecules and lead to global warming. Heart effects on the environment is directly proportional to the negatives quanta and inversely with the positives quanta.&nbsp;The mechanisms of common external driving force and direct interaction are consistent in the sense that an independent element such as the brainstem reticular formation can affect the overall excitability of hippocampal and neocortical areas, thus setting the stage for a functional interaction between them, [1]. Will be explained in this article ambiguous issues related to the universe and its relationship to consciousness, especially the relationship dynamics and static (As Dormancy phases ), in the biological universe by positioning synchronization, as well as to bring about equilibrium and chemical physicist of the cells according to the mathematical engineering and links is [Pi, δ , d] Association, and how the molecular interaction simultaneous topically with complementary else, according to the pathways and processes.The issue of time travel, the synthesis of self-molecules, the construction of the crystalline spectra, entropy time, fractals, physical events like night and day, and our vision of distant stars, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, cancer mechanism and how to get rid of it, also injured veterans shocked and how to help them, science, as well as the DNA of the atom. And the possibility of creating a self-treatment for some diseases caused by dynamic and static,  that way and be that (the healing) will give fast-acting and safe results. And also clarify the interaction mechanism between the waves emitted from the body in the environment such as climate equilibrium. Method used is the observation and experience and then infer a mathematical formula and spectral structure of fractals and so I wrote this , as well as some scientific terms agreed .The exchange of material between systems , as well as the exchange of entropy and heat as the mechanism of interaction temperature part of it remains as a genetic fingerprint to allow re-shape ( Morphology ) of atomic structures and also convert energy into matter . Atomic structure of the spectrum shows the presence of a dual system and the mechanism of occurrence of reversible reactions in terms of the effect of time on the speed and direction of quantum entropy. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress ( Wilson, Anne, et al.,2008) &nbsp;[2]. Thus, in cellular biological system of the human contains various systems , including internal physiological controlled by the sensory cells , which alerts that explain the directives cells and the mechanism of their interaction with the surrounding environment system. This means internal selectors , there are particles or pettiness be in need of energy from an external source in sync with the process of repositioning to make interactions construction , whether in the form of exchange of energy , cytothesis , metabolism, or induces the entry developed a certain dormancy may be in order to be breaking the phases and then to relocate to another phase.A trend for an association between lower amounts of REM sleep and higher evening cortisol concentrations independent of age was detected (P&lt;.10) 3. A very small group of brain cells (perhaps totaling just 100,000 in humans) at the base of the forebrain is maximally active only during non-REM sleep. These cells have been called sleep-on neurons and appear to be responsible for inducing sleep. The precise signals that activate the sleep-on neurons are not yet completely understood, but increased body heat while an individual is awake clearly activates some of these cells, which may explain the drowsiness that so often accompanies a hot bath or a summer day at the beach" [4,5,6]. The key neurotransmitters affected— norepinephrine, serotonin and hista- mine—are termed monoamines, because they each contain a chemical entity called an amine group, [7]. whereupon the containment temperature dependent cells sharing in that amount among themselves by absorbing part of the heat this means "Standard enthalpy of formation"  due to changes in  Bio-thermodynamic system , this thermal energy is conserved intracellular without change with the cellular system change , especially biological content inside the cell , which passes into the processes of transformation of the continuous phase and thus ensures the functioning of processes in accordance with the very operations regularity . Furthermore, this prevents the cell from passing into Dormancy phase ( Static ), and then remain it in firing by heat energy and entropy . The heat , as well as going through the processes developed up to the hormones and chemicals that inhibit active  cell phases by synchronized eccentric static.&nbsp;Philosophy is inspirational energy has ability to understand and study the atomic spectrum in its pure state. Thus developed the philosophical ideas as hypotheses (being of future events and require currently Proof) and this is what made humans in a daze when you delve into the issues that are still shrouded in mystery, such as a mechanism of awareness and perception, creativity, diseases, and hopes the essence of philosophy (which is the basis of awareness), we find they are assigned to the heart. Yes, and to be fair we must "accept the centrality of the heart", because the heart is stable inspiration and airstrip sensory information and more comprehensive sense of heart nucleus of a multi- phase configuration and that which translates all sensory messages and convert them into incisive logic. How not there to attract energy, "Biogravitropism" where the magnetic stimulates cells by internal determinants (molecules that control the molecular cellular cognition) for transpiration towards those external influences (the lengths of multiple energy beams) to involuntarily without directing our consciousness so. Mechanism awareness influenced by the quality of the particles cellular consisting of food and drink and ideas that play a key role in the cells of the stimuli response mechanism , so by attracting and translate sensory messages from the environment around us stimulate the domestic determinants in the cells that control the physiological cell to regulate synchronization with external stimuli . Chemical formula for entropy is: Mistakes ( conc ) + Heart→ Hydrogen ryas  [climate global] &nbsp;This means that the emission of rays have the ability to cause genetic changes in the air molecules. Consider the growing number of the world's population and also increased sins in terms of eating foods harm in polymers gene that stimulates a person to commit crimes, not only this, but that the impact of heart waves mounts cumulatively until the ozone layer and affect them and lead to global warming the most influential of these chemicals causes. Why? Some might think that global warming is only the result of chemical residues that rising from factories and other pollutants , but if we look at the essence of the problem, we will see a big difference between the effect of those causes relative to the impact of the human body waves!. Heart makes waves with a large chemical activity of oxygen molecules and this allows it in conjunction with other molecules , according to special crystalline structure only arise out of certain cells in the human body , and these structures are the basis , accounting for containment and molecular recycling. Therefore, how the rays of the heart to reach high to 25 kilometers (established in terms of integration - differential) in the form of energy toroidal chains dynamic, making it up to the ozone layer, to affect the oxygen molecules and earned a chemical activity of such a link, "Bud" (This means that the correlation function in similar polarization), which in turn attracts chlorofluorocarbon molecules, aluminum, nitrogen oxides and other particles, and thus causing the decomposition of the ozone, the emergence of sync Hole attracts cosmic rays heat. And it is not necessary to go into the prolixity of all the listed causes, as well as chemical formulas for the molecules or the way they interact with ozone, and so on.The important thing here is to go to discuss the profound essence of concise manner, and this is in the processes of synthesis rays, which can produce replicates and also stimulate the molecules. For example, the energy stored in the ozone, which have the ability to transform an atomic (allotropy) Due to contain radiation at the quarks may fall within the nucleus, according to atomic development of the elements of the cycle (structural synthesis due to the presence rays contain built fractals as phases simultaneously template). Also the heart plays a key role in learning and understanding and manipulation of sensory information mechanism and share them with the brain. Thus, Pericardium membrane plays a role in understanding and comprehension , especially electrochemical It contains receptors (the role of the pericardium membrane such as "Tunning Circuit  ) ; therefore controls the polarization of low -frequency sound waves , among several conciliatory tones, to the hearing device in the heart. The heart of the audio pathways in engineering positions ( specific measurement angles) .<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
