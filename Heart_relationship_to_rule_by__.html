<h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Heart relationship to rule by Exponential growth function<br></h3><div>The heart is the most powerful source of electromagnetic energy in the human body, producing the largest rhythmic electromagnetic field of any of the body's organs. The heart's electrical field is about 60 times greater in amplitude than the electrical activity generated by the brain. “This field measured in the form of an electrocardiogram (ECG), can be detected anywhere on the surface of the body, (<cite class="squire-citation ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{McCraty_2014,

Moreover, the quantitative growth exponent of the heart is growing even affect the air molecules and lead to global warming. Heart effects on the environment is directly proportional to the negatives quanta and inversely with the positives quanta. “The mechanisms of common external driving force and direct interaction are consistent in the sense that an independent element such as the brainstem reticular formation can affect the overall excitability of hippocampal and neocortical areas, thus setting the stage for a functional interaction between them”,\ citep. Will be explained in this article ambiguous issues related to the universe and its relationship to consciousness, especially the relationship dynamics and static (As Dormancy phases), in the biological universe by positioning synchronization, as well as to bring about equilibrium and chemical physicist of the cells according to the mathematical engineering and links is , π σ etc. Association, and how the molecular interaction simultaneous topically with complementary else, according to the pathways and processes.The issue of time travel, the synthesis of self-molecules, the construction of the crystalline spectra, entropy time, fractals, physical events like night and day, and our vision of distant stars, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, cancer mechanism and how to get rid of it, also injured veterans shocked and how to help them, science, as well as the DNA of the atom. And the possibility of creating a self-treatment for some diseases caused by dynamic and static,  that way and be that (the healing) will give fast-acting and safe results. And also clarify the interaction mechanism between the waves emitted from the body in the environment such as climate equilibrium. Method used is the observation and experience and then infer a mathematical formula and spectral structure of fractals and so I wrote this , as well as some scientific terms agreed .The exchange of material between systems , as well as the exchange of entropy and heat as the mechanism of interaction temperature part of it remains as a genetic fingerprint to allow re-shape (Morphology) of atomic structures and also convert energy into matter . Atomic structure of the spectrum shows the presence of a dual system and the mechanism of occurrence of reversible reactions in terms of the effect of time on the speed and direction of quantum entropy. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress  &nbsp;[2]. Thus, in cellular biological system of the human contains various systems , including internal physiological controlled by the sensory cells , which alerts that explain the directives cells and the mechanism of their interaction with the surrounding environment system. This means internal selectors , there are particles or pettiness be in need of energy from an external source in sync with the process of repositioning to make interactions construction , whether in the form of exchange of energy , cytothesis , metabolism, or induces the entry developed a certain dormancy may be in order to be breaking the phases and then to relocate to another phase.A trend for an association between lower amounts of REM sleep and higher evening cortisol concentrations independent of age was detected (P&lt;.10) [3].Thus, the phase synchronization mechanism affected by the content of internal limitation. &nbsp;A very small group of brain cells (perhaps totaling just 100,000 in humans) at the base of the forebrain is maximally active only during non-REM sleep. These cells have been called sleep-on neurons and appear to be responsible for inducing sleep. The precise signals that activate the sleep-on neurons are not yet completely understood, but increased body heat while an individual is awake clearly activates some of these cells, which may explain the drowsiness that so often accompanies a hot bath or a summer day at the beach" [4,5,6]. NREM sleep is separated into light sleep (slowing of the EEG, presence of sleep spindles and K-complexes) and deep slow-wave sleep. Slow waves reflect synchronization of periods of neuronal depolarization/high firing (up-phase) followed by periods of hyperpolarization (down phase) within large areas of the cortex.   [7, 8]. Therefore, those changes resulting from coupling eccentric opposing dynamically, where associated with each edge static phase (dormancy), with the edge of another active phase (firing), that is when the opposite phases are connected to form synaptic during which the exchange of synchronous dynamic effects, as rhythmic firing.&nbsp;whereupon the containment temperature dependent cells sharing in that quanta among themselves by absorbing part of the heat (this means "Standard enthalpy of formation"), due to changes in  Bio-thermodynamic system, this thermal energy is conserved intracellular without change with the cellular system change , especially biological content inside the cell, which passes into the processes of transformation of the continuous phase and thus ensures the functioning of processes in accordance with the very operations regularity . Furthermore, this prevents the cell from passing into Dormancy phase (static), and then remain it in firing by heat energy and entropy . The heat , as well as going through the processes developed up to the hormones and chemicals that inhibit active  cell phases by synchronized eccentric static.&nbsp;Philosophy is inspirational energy has ability to understand and study the atomic spectrum in its pure state. Thus developed the philosophical ideas as hypotheses (being of future events and require currently Proof) and this is what made humans in a daze when you delve into the issues that are still shrouded in mystery, such as a mechanism of awareness and perception, creativity, diseases, and hopes the essence of philosophy (which is the basis of awareness), we find they are assigned to the heart. Yes, and to be fair we must "accept the centrality of the heart", because the heart is stable inspiration and airstrip sensory information and more comprehensive sense of heart nucleus of a multi- phase configuration and that which translates all sensory messages and convert them into incisive logic. How not there to attract energy, Bio-gravitropism where the magnetic stimulates cells by internal Limitation&nbsp;(molecules that control the molecular cellular cognition) for transpiration towards those external influences (the lengths of multiple energy beams) to involuntarily without directing our consciousness so. Mechanism awareness influenced by the quality of the particles cellular consisting of food and drink and ideas that play a key role in the cells of the stimuli response mechanism , so by attracting and translate sensory messages from the environment around us stimulate the domestic determinants in the cells that control the physiological cell to regulate synchronization with external stimuli . Chemical formula for entropy is: <br></div><div>“Global warming” .&nbsp;\ O_{3→2} ∝ With quanta accumulation of negative behavior of the heart (which increases the emission of heart waves) &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></div><div>This means that the emission of rays have the ability to cause genetic changes in the air molecules. Consider the growing number of the world's population and also increased sins in terms of eating foods harm in polymers gene that stimulates a person to commit crimes, not only this, but that the impact of heart waves mounts cumulatively until the ozone layer and affect them and lead to global warming the most influential of these chemicals causes. Why? Some might think that global warming is only the result of chemical residues that rising from factories and other pollutants but if we look at the essence of the problem, we will see a big difference between the effect of those causes relative to the impact of the human body waves!. Heart makes waves with a large chemical activity of oxygen molecules and this allows it in conjunction with other molecules, according to special crystalline structure only arise out of certain cells in the human body &nbsp;and these structures are the basis, accounting for containment and molecular recycling. Therefore, how the rays of the heart to reach high to 25 kilometers (established in terms of integration-differential) in the form of energy toroidal chains dynamic, making it up to the ozone layer, to affect the oxygen molecules and earned a chemical activity of such a link, "Bud" (This means that the correlation function in similar polarization), which in turn attracts chlorofluorocarbon molecules, aluminum, nitrogen oxides and other particles, and thus causing the decomposition of the ozone, the emergence of sync Hole attracts cosmic rays heat. And it is not necessary to go into the prolixity of all the listed causes, as well as chemical formulas for the molecules or the way they interact with ozone, and so on.The important thing here is to go to discuss the profound essence of concise manner, and this is in the processes of synthesis rays, which can produce replicates and also stimulate the molecules. For example, the energy stored in the ozone, which have the ability to transform an atomic (allotropy) Due to contain radiation at the quarks may fall within the nucleus, according to atomic development of the elements of the cycle (structural synthesis due to the presence rays contain built fractals as phases simultaneously template). Also the heart plays a key role in learning and understanding and manipulation of sensory information mechanism and share them with the brain. Thus, Pericardium membrane plays a role in understanding and comprehension, especially electrochemical It contains receptors (the role of the pericardium membrane such as "Tunning Circuit”)  therefore controls the polarization of low-frequency sound waves, among several conciliatory tones, to the hearing device in the heart. The heart of the audio pathways in engineering positions (specific measurement angles) . Finally, on earth everyone has one heart   , but all the spectra of the hearts -in the air- be a coalition of crystalline structure. Blood pressure disease arises as a result of malfunction rhythm concurrent phases between crystalline systems inside the heart and abroad, as well as cardiac angina whose symptoms change unit person behavior and “paranoia” on the evolution of the hearing nerves such as combined with a certain affinity molecules, as a result of the practice of lying and some intellectual issues which lead to the disruption of dynamic nerves heart. Also the relationship of these processes with neurological coalitions in the lower part of the abdomen and the front lobe of the brain and liver. &nbsp;<br></div><h4>Liver role of a complement to the heart<br></h4><div>Thus, the human body the source of the wave of viruses that infect the nervous system. There is a connection between low-frequency sound waves, (which can not be heard), and liver, which are stable and place those frequencies translated especially harmful frequencies as materials that are toxic, therefore, accumulate in the liver and then caused a sharp behavior. And activated electrical processes between the heart and the liver in the form of exchange of synchronized phases during sunrise-to-night.&nbsp;Therefore, the Universe and all the creatures pose with a dynamic equilibrium concurrent systems, and from it we can heat and energy containment at finding appropriate crystalline structure. Energy and can travel in the pathways especially attractive and the transition to the material (This means that we in the case of a synchronous rhythm with the edges of the Universe, we influence as well as we are affected).&nbsp;<br></div><h5>Conclusion <br></h5><div>“While cell need special conditions of dynamics to activate their interactions” thus, each cell different biological response because of the different molecules that make up those cells, as well as every cell needs to activate synchronized either to absorb the energy compensation, to break the process of static Association to move to another phase, or for eccentric engage in a process of static. And that mechanism is subject to "Internal Limitation" (that called  Morphological)  which is produced by the person's behavior (In terms of, eating, drinking and ideas, etc), after that turn into molecules against the directives of Internal Limitation, and thus may slow or prevent interaction with external influences that gives energy cells stillness synchronized rhythmic pattern with “Rest Period”, which caused particles depend metabolised to absorb the energy from an external source to carry out its functions (for example: agglutination molecules, waste disposal, breaking a certain process of association, etc), is one of the types of disability, (“Insomnia”), which is the result of molecular That have permeability optional, therefore, prevent the entry of energy compensation for the synthesis of the hormone serotonin, molecular that which are found in cell membranes, especially on the pericardium membrane,(Covers the heart), leading to increased entropy of the nervous system. Thus, to the lack of synergy between the nervous regulation and hormonal regulation leads to entropy look in the form of anxiety or “insomnia” and other causes that prevent cells from entering the phase dormancy (Sleep), this means that the night contains that multi-energy, such as energy compensation, to stimulate the synthesis of hormones and regularity of metabolism. Dynamic equilibrium of the cells in a complementary manner that is firing because of "Chemical dormancy", in the cells, which is the presence of hormones. Cells may be surrounded by molecules hinder interaction , and this means that the dynamic cell system is influenced by "Surrouning" because it contains molecules that play a role in the processes of phase synchronous (in terms of permeability to make optional damping or the firing of certain neurons), to ensure complementary occurrence of interactions necessary for metabolism and other processes. Therefore, we will add another property to the properties of thermodynamics changes in biological systems namely : Isofractal, which does not occur to the existence of an integral appropriately, and time constant.&nbsp;The exchange of energy and material for each dynamic system through phases of internal isolated system synchronization.<br></div><div>Sound waves play a role in the synthesis of their ability to recombination, as well as turn out to different isotopes reversible when paired with other particles in accordance with the complementary process.&nbsp;<br></div><div>As the electromagnetic field of the heart—that the world's population also Producers of ultraviolet ryas. “The presence of a single-atom of nitrogen (N2) in the upper layers of the atmosphere which absorbs UV radiation” (that emitted from the heart) leading to the production of nitrogenous (NO_2) then<br></div><div>&lt;ol&gt;<br></div><div>&lt;li&gt;2N2O + heart-rays &amp;rarr; N2 + 2NO&lt;/li&gt;<br></div><div>&lt;li&gt;2NO + O&nbsp; &amp;rarr;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO2&lt;/li&gt;<br></div><div>&lt;/ol&gt;<br></div><div><br></div><div>(NO2), which affects the ozone layer, because it consists of energetic frequencies. Therefore, the peoples  (due to their behavior in foods that contain harmful free radicals), are one of the causes of global warming more than the impact of fossil fuel waste.<br></div><h6>References<br></h6><div>1- Siapas, Athanassios G., and Matthew A.
