<div>Hypotheses :<br></div><div>1. Everything has a hollow construction .<br></div><div>2. Each stage has much the end , all the stages as mattresses differential.<br></div><div>3- Each spectrum emitted contains a gene atoms and can be converted into a crystal isotopes of those atoms through integrative interaction with the outside system.<br></div><div>4- Each radio spectrum is not exhausted and can be turned into material when integrating into the crystalline structure .<br></div><div>5- Each spectrum entropy constructivism.<br></div><div>6- Each atom has two types of time- Energy.<br></div><div>7- [H2O] in every atom , but it is subject to chemical decomposition ( turning continuously phasic ) .<br></div><div>8- No incomplete quanta and also will not accrue any of the quanta to zero.The behavior is the crystalline structure of the nucleus.<br></div><div><br></div>
