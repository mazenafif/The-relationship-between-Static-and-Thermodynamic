<div>Hypotheses :<br></div><div>1. Everything has a hollow construction .<br></div><div>2. Each state has developed a beginning and an end .<br></div><div>3- Each spectrum emitted contains a gene atoms and can be converted into a crystal isotopes of those atoms through integrative interaction with the outside system.<br></div><div>4- Each radio spectrum is not exhausted and can be turned into material when integrating into the crystalline structure .<br></div><div>5- Each spectrum entropy constructivism.<br></div><div>6- Each atom has two types of time-Energy.&nbsp;Therefore we can travel through time in a counter-clockwise direction at certain points where he stays for a short time only. The farthest point is the nearest point and vice versa in accordance with the principle of synchronous orbits .<br></div><div>7- [H2O] in every atom , but it is subject to chemical decomposition ( turning continuously phasic ) .<br></div><div>8- No incomplete quanta and also will not accrue any of the quanta-to-zero.<br></div><div>9-The Pattern of behavior is the crystalline structure of the nucleus, thus, that measured behavior patterns as a synchronous rhythm change molecular mass in the nucleus.<br></div><div>10- Each nucleus coupling link and so active phases synchronization induce molecules to bring about  dynamics equilibrium and be either absorb energy compensation is needed to break the process of static Association and stimulate interaction or emission of quanta energy by urging internal determinants to enter the process of static ( developed physiological ) , and therefore parallel resurgence positions arise and it determines spectroscopy magnetic fields <br></div><div><br></div>
