<div><u><b>Chapter 2:&nbsp;Awareness mechanism indetermining human behavior:</b></u><br></div><div><b style="text-decoration: underline;"></b>Apart from addressing the structural processes that are exposed those signals influential as it passed through various sensory receptors inside and outside the cells. Rest on how the impact of those signals<br></div><div>Sensory receptors receive several waves splash reciprocating especially cellular receptors audio scattered on the body. It is a multi We are aware of some of those singles, others are unaware That means receives those influences unconsciously , but all of those influences when they arrive to the cellular receptors are subject to a request to authorize the&nbsp; acceptance - rejection , this means that the approval of the Contact voluntarily by the person . After accepting signals from the heart into the nerve of the heart cells , particularly the cells responsible for understanding and perception, and this means that the indicated amount of intellectual audible serve as a familiar polarization leads to the control of the receptor cell to identify and control the key to accept - reject any work synthesis allows the passage of signals that are consistent with that familiarity only, and it increases the amount of these particles to become responsible for directing the views and behavior of the person. For example, we give examples of some of these behaviors and the impact on knowledge. After the death of the prophets fabricated ideas appear and are attributed to a particular prophet, to reach personal goals, or for other purposes, and may be due to differing only members and everyone have a group against the other may be for one reason only personal differences and then those ideas become sacred at every group, however over the years, those ideas become religious doctrines developed on the basis of hate and fight against anyone who violates their opinions. Because of the psychology of human beings, every belief stay long in the heart become an essential part of the structure of DNA and the person can give it up, this means that the molecules thread inside the cell is proportional to the period of time, and therefore become cognition cell colony can not accept ideas are incompatible with what's inside.<br></div>
